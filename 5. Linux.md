## 70. What is the difference between /proc, /sys, and /dev directories?

| Directory | Description                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `/proc`   | Virtual files showing **process and kernel info**  |
| `/sys`    | Provides info about **devices and drivers**        |

## 71. What are inodes in Linux?

**Explanation:**

* An **inode** is a data structure that stores metadata about a file (size, owner, permissions, etc.) — not the file name.
* File names are mapped to inodes in directories.

**Command:**

```bash
ls -i
```

**Example:**

```
128953 report.txt
```

**Tip:**
If inode table is full, you cannot create new files even if space is available.

## 72. What is the difference between nohup, screen, and tmux?

| Tool     | Description                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `nohup`  | Runs a command immune to hangups          |
| `screen` | Creates detachable terminal sessions      |
| `tmux`   | Modern terminal multiplexer (like screen) |

**Examples:**

```bash
nohup longscript.sh &
screen -S mysession
tmux new -s project

## 77. How do you troubleshoot high CPU usage in Linux?

**Commands:**

top
ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head
```

**Steps:**

You can also use `htop` or `pidstat` for detailed analysis.

---

## 78. How do you kill multiple processes matching a pattern?

**Commands:**

```bash
pkill process_name
killall process_name
```

Both commands terminate all processes that match the given name.

---

## 79. What is a zombie process in Linux?

**Explanation:**

* A **zombie process** has completed execution but still exists in the process table because its parent hasn’t read its exit status.
* It consumes no resources but can fill the process table if many exist.

**Check:**

```bash
ps aux | grep Z
```

**Fix:**
Kill or restart the **parent process**.
