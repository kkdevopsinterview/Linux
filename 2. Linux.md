## 1. What is Linux? How is it different from Windows?

**Explanation:**
- **Linux** is an open-source, Unix-like operating system that manages hardware, software, and system resources.  
- **Windows** is a proprietary OS developed by Microsoft.

**Key Differences:**
| Feature | Linux | Windows |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Source Code | Open-source | Closed-source |
| Cost | Free | Paid |
| Security | Highly secure | Prone to malware |
| Interface | CLI + GUI | Mostly GUI |
| File System | Case-sensitive | Not case-sensitive |

**Interview Tip:**  
Say you use Linux in servers because it’s lightweight, stable, and preferred in DevOps and cloud environments.

## 2. What are the different Linux distributions?

**Explanation:**
Linux distributions (distros) are variations of Linux built using the same kernel but with different package managers and user interfaces.

**Examples:**
- **Debian-based:** Ubuntu, Kali Linux  
- **Red Hat-based:** CentOS, Fedora, RHEL  
- **Others:** Arch Linux, SUSE, Alpine  

**Use Case:**  
In DevOps, RHEL or Ubuntu are most common because they are stable and well-supported.

## 3. Explain the Linux file system hierarchy.

**Explanation:**
Linux uses a **tree-like file structure** starting from the root directory `/`.

**Important Directories:**
| Directory | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| `/` | Root directory |
| `/home` | User home directories |
| `/etc` | Configuration files |
| `/var` | Variable data (logs, mail, etc.) |
| `/bin` | Essential user binaries |
| `/sbin` | System binaries |
| `/usr` | User programs |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files |
| `/dev` | Device files |
| `/proc` | System and process information |

**Tip:**  
You can visualize it by running `tree / -L 1` (requires `tree` package).

---

## 4. What are the basic Linux file permissions?

**Explanation:**
Every file or directory has three types of permissions:
- **Read (r)** – 4
- **Write (w)** – 2
- **Execute (x)** – 1

**Permission Types:**
| Owner | Group | Others |
|--------|--------|---------|
| rwx | r-- | r-- |

**Example:**
```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
````

This gives full permission to the owner and read/execute to others.

---

## 5. How do you check the current working directory?

**Command:**

```bash
pwd
```

**Explanation:**

* Displays the absolute path of your current directory.
* Example:

```bash
$ pwd
/home/ec2-user/projects
```

---

## 6. What command is used to list files and directories?

**Command:**

```bash
ls
```

**Common Options:**

* `ls -l` → Long listing format
* `ls -a` → Show hidden files
* `ls -lh` → Human-readable file sizes

**Example:**

```bash
ls -lh /var/log
```

---

## 7. How do you create, delete, move, and rename files in Linux?

**Commands:**

```bash
# Create
touch file.txt

# Delete
rm file.txt

# Move or Rename
mv old.txt new.txt
mv file.txt /tmp/
```

**Example:**
To rename `test1.txt` → `test2.txt`:

```bash
mv test1.txt test2.txt
```

---

## 8. How do you view the contents of a file?

**Commands:**

```bash
cat filename.txt     # View complete file
more filename.txt    # View page by page
less filename.txt    # Scroll up/down
head filename.txt    # Show first 10 lines
tail filename.txt    # Show last 10 lines
```

**Example:**

```bash
tail -f /var/log/messages
```

→ Monitors a log file in real-time.

---

## 9. What is the difference between absolute and relative paths?

| Type              | Description                   | Example                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Absolute Path** | Starts from root `/`          | `/home/user/docs/file.txt` |
| **Relative Path** | Starts from current directory | `../file.txt`              |

**Tip:**
Use `pwd` to confirm absolute location before using relative paths.

---

## 10. How do you check disk space usage in Linux?

**Commands:**

```bash
df -h     # Shows disk space usage
du -sh *  # Shows space used by each directory
```

**Example Output:**

```
Filesystem      Size  Used  Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/xvda1       40G   12G    26G  32% /
```

---

## 11. What is the difference between rm, rmdir, and rm -rf?

| Command  | Description                                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `rm`     | Removes files                                        |
| `rmdir`  | Removes empty directories only                       |
| `rm -rf` | Forcefully removes directories and files recursively |

**Example:**

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/old_logs
```

**Warning:**
`rm -rf /` can delete the entire system — use carefully.

---

## 12. How do you create a new user and group in Linux?

**Commands:**

```bash
# Create group
groupadd devops

# Create user and assign group
useradd -m -g devops prasanth

# Set password
passwd prasanth
```

**Check user details:**

```bash
id prasanth
```

---

## 13. What is the purpose of the passwd command?

**Explanation:**
The `passwd` command is used to **set or change the password** of a user.

**Example:**

```bash
passwd prasanth
```

* Prompts for a new password.
* Updates the `/etc/shadow` file with the encrypted value.

---

## 14. How do you change file ownership in Linux?

**Command:**

```bash
chown owner:group filename
```

**Example:**

```bash
chown ec2-user:devops report.txt
```

**Explanation:**

* Changes both file owner and group.
* Requires root privileges.

---

## 15. What is the purpose of the chmod command?

**Explanation:**
Used to **change permissions** for files and directories.

**Syntax:**

```bash
chmod [permissions] filename
```

**Example:**

```bash
chmod 644 file.txt     # rw-r--r--
chmod 755 script.sh    # rwxr-xr-x
```

## 16. What are hard links and soft links?

| Type                     | Description                           | Command             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Hard Link**            | Points to same inode as original file | `ln file1 file2`    |
| **Soft Link (Symbolic)** | Shortcut to another file              | `ln -s file1 link1` |

**Tip:**
Deleting original file breaks the soft link but not the hard link.
